  <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>
      I am very extroverted and enjoy having meaningful conversations with people. I do my best to have a welcoming and positive attitude towards those around me. My friends and family would describe me as joyful and ambitious. I value having compassion for others, regardless if they hold different beliefs or opinions. I find it important to be accepting of diverse groups of people so that I may learn more about new ideas and experiences from them. I gained the value of hard work during my time in high school. This principle was instilled in me at a young age by my parents, and I am very grateful to have received their guidance growing up. As I realized my passion in working with technology and people, I began taking accountability for my own learning and enjoyed exploring my different interests.
