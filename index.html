    <p>This website is built with HTML and deployed using GitHub. This website is going to be about me. My name is Erica, and I am a student at Texas A&M. My hobbies include playing volleyball and card games with my friends, traveling with my family, playing piano, and painting. My favorite movie is She's The Man, and my favorite tv show is Gilmore Girls. My dream vacation spot is Switzerland, and I would love to go the mountains. </p>
