    <h1>Erica Le's Favorite Hobbies</h1>
    <h3>Thanks for visiting my website!</h3>

    <p> Howdy, my name is Erica Le! I am a junior at Texas A&M University, and I am majoring in Management Information Systems. My hobbies include playing piano, traveling with my family, painting, and playing volleyball and card games with my friends. I used to take piano lessons throughout elementary and middle school. However, I recently picked up playing piano again at the end of my senior year of high school. Some of my favorite songs to play are "Golden Hour" by JVKE and "Je te laisserai des mots" by Patrick Watson. Additionally, my family and I love taking road trips to visit my family in California. Every summer, we spend around two and a half days driving and sometimes stop by national parks, such as White Sands National Park in New Mexico. I always look forward to spending time with my cousins and grandparents. Another hobby of mine is painting. Although I am not an extraordinary artist, I enjoy painting mountains, waterfalls, and other scenic sites. Lastly, some of my favorite pastimes in college are playing sand volleyball and pool with my friends. My friends and I are very competitive, espcially at the card game called ERS. I always have a good time, even though I often lose. I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit more about me. Thanks for reading!</p>
